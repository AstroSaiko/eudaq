miniTLU Producer

=== To start the program

The miniTLU executable needs uhal libraries and their dependencies in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. If these libraries are not default on your system you can copy and modify the script producers/miniTLU/etc/start_minitlu.sh to setup the environment and start the producer.

The producer needs some configuration in the .conf file:

[Producer.TLU]

# in this xml file it's specified the connection protocol and address
ConnectionFile = file://connection.xml
# the name of the connection to use
DeviceName = minitlu

# (optional) the interval in clock cycles between internally generated triggers
InternalTriggerInterval = 100000000

# (optional) DAC threshold values
DACThreshold0 = 0x4100
DACThreshold1 = 0x4100
DACThreshold2 = 0x4100
DACThreshold3 = 0x4100


Two other configuration files are needed:
- connection.xml
- miniTLU.xml

You can find these files in producers/miniTLU/etc and you must copy them in the working directory. You may want to edit connection.xml to reflect your network configuration, you don't want to edit miniTLU.xml.

=== To compile

Look at cmake/FindCACTUS.cmake and edit it if it doesn't fit your system.

Then:

cd build
cmake -D BUILD_miniTLU=ON ..
make
make install

=== Known bugs

The first time you connect with IPBus 1 protocol (default) it may fail. Try again. If the second time fails it's an error.
